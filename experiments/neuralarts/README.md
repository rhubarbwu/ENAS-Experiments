# Type-Generated Search Spaces for ENAS

## The Generator(s)

- Convolutions: the convolution-based search space generator is defined in `generate_conv.py` and can be used to fix or range three convolution properties: kernel size, padding, dilation. The corresponding `k_limit`, `p_limit`, and `d_limit` should be `None`, positive integer, or an inclusive positive integer range, and should be one of the following combinations.
  1. One `None`, one fixed integer (like `3`), one integer range (like `(3,6)`).
  2. One `None`, two integer ranges (like `(3,6)`).

## Experiments

### Brute-Force (T1\_\*)

Our first experimental group consists of search spaces generated by brute-force using two ranges, with the increasing upper ranges 4/8/12/16, on each pair combination of the three parameters. The third parameter will be `None` meaning it's "free" and determined as a function of the other two.

- The `vv` in `T1_vvuu` defines the variables that are ranged. For example `kd` means the kernel size and dilation are ranged and the padding is deterministic.
- The `uu` in `T1_vvuu` defines the upper range of the ranged variables. For example `08` means the upper (inclusive) bound of the experiment is 8.
